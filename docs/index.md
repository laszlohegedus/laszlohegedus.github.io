# About me

I am a software developer based in Hungary, currently working for Erlang Solutions
as an Erlang and Elixir consultant. My main interests are backend development,
distributed systems and infrastructure automation. I have had the chance to try
multiple programming languages in professional environments and I believe we should
not stick to one paradigm over another. Rather, we should take what we
think are good practices in one paradigm and apply them to make our solutions
cleaner and safer.

Check out my [Blog](blog.md) where I intend to collect some of my ideas and also keep track
of projects and what I do. I have a full time job, so the posts are rather
infrequent, unless I'm between projects.

Feel free to use (at your own risk) whatever I share here. I appreciate any
comments, kudos, recommendations and tips. Especially if you found my content
useful. See [Contact](contact.md) for details.
